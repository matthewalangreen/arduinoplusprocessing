// we're going to write pseudocode... its a way to plan without having to write working code



// working features
// 
// 

// features to change
// size();
// ball movement
//  move until "change" in direction noticed
//  shouldn't be able to move diagonally

// features to add
// eat "apple" add an ellipse & change color
// score keeper
// end game sequence
// background color/picture
// hit walls, game over
// go "opposite" direction, game over
// speed up each time you eat an "apple"



// ball movement ideas

// set random movement direction at game start
//  

// if its moving up, don't let it move any other direction
// if its moving down...
// if its moving left...
// if its moving right...
